This software is a computer program whose purpose is to detect cerebral
vascular tree bifurcations within MRA-TOF acquisitions.

"INSERM Transfert" is currently working on the license to be applied to this computer program.
So, this is a work in progress...

However, in short, you can use this program for free;
once the license is finalized, you will be able to distribute the program (under the same license).

You are not allowed to commercialize this program without our approval.
